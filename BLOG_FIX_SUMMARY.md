# Blog Display Fix - Summary

## Problem
After publishing a blog post in the admin panel, the BLOG section appeared empty in both Polish (PL) and English (EN) versions. This was caused by a **race condition** between loading CMS data from the server and rendering the blog posts.

## Root Cause
The blog pages (`blog.html` and `blog-pl.html`) were reading blog posts from `localStorage` immediately on `DOMContentLoaded`, but the `cms-sync.js` script loads data from the server **asynchronously**. This meant the blog rendering code ran before the CMS data (including blog posts) was loaded from the server, resulting in empty blog sections.

## Solution
Modified all blog and post display files to wait for CMS content to be loaded from the server before attempting to display posts:

### Files Fixed:
1. **`/workspace/blog.html`** - English blog listing page
2. **`/workspace/blog-pl.html`** - Polish blog listing page  
3. **`/workspace/post.html`** - English individual post page
4. **`/workspace/post-pl.html`** - Polish individual post page

### Key Changes:
- Made the `DOMContentLoaded` event handler **async**
- Added `await window.cmsLoadFromServer()` before loading blog posts
- Refactored blog post loading into a separate `loadBlogPosts()` function for better organization
- Added hover effects to blog cards for improved UX
- Added safety checks for `copyright-year` element existence

## How It Works Now
```
1. Page loads â†’ cms-sync.js loads data from server to localStorage
2. DOMContentLoaded fires â†’ wait for CMS sync to complete
3. Load blog posts from localStorage (now populated)
4. Display posts on page
```

## Storage Keys Used
- **English posts**: `localStorage.getItem('blogPostsEN')`
- **Polish posts**: `localStorage.getItem('blogPostsPL')`

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Publish a Test Post
1. Go to admin panel (`admin.html`)
2. Navigate to "Blog Posts (EN)" or "Blog Posts (PL)" section
3. Create a new blog post with:
   - Title
   - Content (using rich text editor)
   - Optional: Image, meta description, featured snippet
4. Click "Save Blog Post"
5. Click the green "ðŸ“¤ Publikuj TreÅ›ci Online" button to sync to server

### 2. Verify Display
1. Open `blog.html` (English) or `blog-pl.html` (Polish)
2. You should see your published posts displayed as cards
3. Click on a post card to open the full post
4. Verify that the post content renders correctly

### 3. Test Both Languages
- Ensure posts are visible in both EN and PL versions
- Verify language switcher works correctly
- Check that clicking a post opens the correct language version

## Additional Improvements
- Added `hover:shadow-lg transition-shadow` CSS classes for better visual feedback
- Improved error messages consistency
- Added null checks to prevent errors when elements don't exist

- `cms-sync.js` - Handles syncing localStorage with server
- `admin.html` - Admin panel for creating/editing blog posts
- `.netlify/functions/cms-content.js` - Server function for CMS data persistence

## Notes
- Blog posts are stored in `localStorage` and synced to server via Netlify function
- The landing directory (`/workspace/landing/`) appears to have older versions using different storage keys (`blogPosts`) - these were not modified as they seem to be legacy files
- Documents are excluded from CMS sync due to size limitations
