## Technical Details

### Data Storage
All partner data is stored in localStorage:
- `partnersTitle` - English title
- `partnersTitlePl` - Polish title
- `partnersSubtitle` - English subtitle
- `partnersSubtitlePl` - Polish subtitle
- `strategicPartners` - JSON array of partner objects

### Partner Object Structure
```javascript
{
  "name": "PAKO LORENTE",
  "logo": "images/pako-lorente-logo.png",
  "url": "https://pakolorente.com" // optional
}
```

### Default Content
If no partners are configured, the system automatically adds PAKO LORENTE as the default partner on first load.

## Styling & Design
- **Section background**: Light gray (`bg-gray-50`)
- **Partner cards**: White background with subtle shadow
- **Hover effect**: Logos transition from grayscale to color
- **Responsive**: Automatically adjusts grid columns based on screen size
- **Professional appearance**: Clean, modern design matching the site's aesthetic

## Pages Affected
1. `index-fashion.html` (English Fashion Homepage)
2. `index-fashion-pl.html` (Polish Fashion Homepage)
3. `admin.html` (Admin Panel - new management section)

## Notes
- Partners are shared between EN and PL versions (same logos)
- Only the section titles/subtitles differ between languages
- Logos should be optimized for web (compressed, appropriate size)
- If a logo fails to load, the partner name will be displayed as fallback

## Support
If you need to add more partners or modify the section layout, you can:
1. Use the admin panel for content management
2. Edit the HTML directly in the page files for structural changes
3. Modify the CSS classes for styling adjustments
