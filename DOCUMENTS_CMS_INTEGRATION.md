# Documents CMS Integration - Completed

## Problem
The "Your Documents" pages in both English (`your-documents.html`) and Polish (`your-documents-pl.html`) versions were not properly integrated with the CMS system, making it impossible to edit the text content through the admin panel.

## Solution
I've successfully integrated both document pages with the CMS system. The pages now load their text content from `localStorage`, which is synced with `cms-data.json` through the `cms-sync.js` system.

## Changes Made

### 1. English Version (`your-documents.html`)
- Added `id="documents-title"` to the main heading
- Added `id="documents-message"` to the description paragraph
- Updated the JavaScript to load CMS content on page load using the following keys:
  - `documentsTitle` - Main page heading
  - `documentsMessage` - Description text

### 2. Polish Version (`your-documents-pl.html`)
- Added `id="documents-title"` to the main heading (already existed)
- Added `id="documents-message"` to the description paragraph (already existed)
- Consolidated the duplicate `DOMContentLoaded` event listeners into one
- Updated to load Polish CMS content using:
  - `plDocumentsTitle` - Polish main heading
  - `plDocumentsMessage` - Polish description text
- Changed login redirect from `login.html` to `login-pl.html` for consistency
- Changed delete button text from "Delete" to "Usuń" (Polish)

## CMS Keys in cms-data.json

The following keys are now properly used:

### English:
```json
"documentsTitle": "Your Documents",
"documentsMessage": "No documents available yet."
```

### Polish:
```json
"plDocumentsTitle": "Twoje dokumenty",
"plDocumentsMessage": "Brak dokumentów do wyświetlenia."
```

## How It Works

1. **Content Loading**: When a user visits either documents page, the page loads text content from `localStorage` using the helper function `t(key, fallback)`
2. **CMS Sync**: The `cms-sync.js` script automatically syncs all localStorage data (including documents) with the server via Netlify Functions
3. **Admin Editing**: Administrators can edit these text fields through the admin panel, and changes are saved to localStorage and synced to the server
4. **Document Management**: Admins can still upload documents via the admin panel, and these documents are stored in localStorage under the `documents` key

## Testing

To verify the integration works:

1. Login as admin
2. Go to admin panel
3. Look for document text fields (they should be editable)
4. Upload a document
5. Click "Publikuj Zmiany Online" to sync changes
6. Visit the documents page (both EN and PL versions)
7. Verify the uploaded document appears and text is correct

## Notes

- Documents are stored as base64-encoded data URLs in localStorage
- The system stores an array of objects with `name` and `data` fields
- Admins see a "Delete" / "Usuń" button next to each document
- Regular users only see documents they have access to
- The login requirement is enforced on both pages before any content loads
