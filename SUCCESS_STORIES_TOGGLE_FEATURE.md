# Success Stories Toggle Feature

## Overview
Added functionality to show/hide the Success Stories navigation tab in both English and Polish versions of the website through the CMS Admin Dashboard.

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **`/workspace/landing/admin.html`**
   - Added "Navigation Settings" section at the top of the Admin Dashboard
   - Included a toggle switch for Success Stories visibility
   - Added JavaScript to save/load the toggle state from localStorage
   - Supports bilingual labels (EN: Visible/Hidden, PL: Widoczne/Ukryte)

2. **`/workspace/landing/auth.js`**
   - Added `updateSuccessStoriesVisibility()` function
   - Function finds all Success Stories links (both EN and PL) and shows/hides them based on localStorage setting
   - Integrated into the existing `updateNav()` function that runs on every page load

## How It Works

### Admin Configuration
1. Navigate to the Admin Dashboard (`/landing/admin.html`)
2. At the top of the page, you'll see a "Navigation Settings" section with a blue background
3. Toggle the "Success Stories Page" switch:
   - **ON (checked)**: Success Stories tab is visible in navigation
   - **OFF (unchecked)**: Success Stories tab is hidden in navigation
4. Changes are saved automatically to localStorage
5. A confirmation message appears briefly when the setting is changed

### Technical Details

**localStorage Key**: `showSuccessStories`
- Value: `'true'` (visible) or `'false'` (hidden)
- Default: `'true'` (visible if not set)

**Affected Links**:
- English version: All links containing `success-stories.html`
- Polish version: All links containing `success-stories-pl.html`
- Applies to:
  - Desktop navigation menu
  - Mobile navigation menu
  - Footer links

### User Experience
- The toggle affects all pages across the site
- Changes take effect immediately on page reload
- Works for both logged-in and anonymous users
- Applies to both English and Polish language versions simultaneously

## Browser Compatibility
Uses modern browser features:
- localStorage API
- querySelector/querySelectorAll
- CSS peer selectors for toggle styling
- Compatible with all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Testing
To test the feature:
1. Open `/landing/admin.html` (requires admin login)
2. Locate the "Navigation Settings" section at the top
3. Toggle the Success Stories switch OFF
4. Navigate to `/landing/index.html` - Success Stories tab should be hidden
5. Navigate to `/landing/index-pl.html` - Success Stories tab should also be hidden
6. Return to admin and toggle it back ON
7. Verify tabs reappear on both EN and PL versions

## Future Enhancements
The Navigation Settings section can be easily extended to control visibility of other navigation items:
- Blog tab
- About page
- How It Works page
- Custom navigation items
